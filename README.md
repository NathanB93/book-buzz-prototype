# book-buzz-prototype

## Overview

This high fidelity prototype was developed as a proof of concept for 'BookBuzz' an android mobile application which allows users to set reading reminders, track their reading progress by bookmarking books, and catalogue their book collections. 

The project was completed rapidly in a 5 strong team using Agile methodologies, and was an excellent exercise to get a feel for industry standard workflow in practice.
